Q1. Statistics is the study of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data¹.

Q2. There are two types of statistics: descriptive and inferential¹¹. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize data. One way to summarize data is to use measures of central tendency, which show where the center or middle of the data set is located. Examples of measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. Another way to summarize data is to use measures of variation, which show the dispersion or spread among data values. Examples of measures of variation are standard deviation, variance, minimum and maximum variables, kurtosis, and skewness¹¹. Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample¹¹.

Q3. There are two types of data: qualitative or categorical data and quantitative or numerical data¹. Qualitative data describes the data that fits into categories. Quantitative data expresses the data in numbers. Some classifications further divide the data into sub-types such as primary and secondary data, discrete and continuous data, nominal and ordinal data¹.

Q4. The datasets can be categorized as follows:
(i) Grading in exam: Qualitative (Ordinal) Data
(ii) Colour of mangoes: Qualitative (Nominal) Data
(iii) Height data of a class: Quantitative (Continuous) Data
(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: Quantitative (Discrete) Data

Q5. Levels of measurement classify variables into four categories: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio⁶. Nominal variables are categorical variables that have no order or ranking⁶. Ordinal variables are categorical variables that have an order or ranking⁶. Interval variables are numerical variables that have an order or ranking but no natural zero point⁶. Ratio variables are numerical variables that have an order or ranking and a natural zero point⁶.

Q6. It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because it determines which statistical tests can be used on the data⁸. For example, if you have nominal data you cannot use parametric tests such as t-tests or ANOVA because these tests assume that the data is normally distributed⁸.

Q7. Nominal data type is different from ordinal data type because nominal variables are categorical variables that have no order or ranking while ordinal variables are categorical variables that have an order or ranking⁶.

Q8. A box plot can be used to display data in terms of range¹⁵.

Q9. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe characteristics of a dataset while inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on a sample¹¹. An example of descriptive statistics is calculating the mean height of students in a class while an example of inferential statistics is testing whether there is a significant difference between the mean heights of two classes¹¹.

Q10. Some common measures of central tendency include mean, median, and mode while some common measures of variability include range, variance, standard deviation¹¹. The mean is calculated by adding up all values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values. The median is the middle value when all values in a dataset are arranged in order from smallest to largest. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. Range is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in a dataset. Variance is calculated by taking the average squared difference between each value and the mean value in a dataset. Standard deviation is calculated by taking the square root of variance¹¹.

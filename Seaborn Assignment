1. Five plots that we can plot using the Seaborn library are:
    - Line Plot: It is used to visualize the relationship between two variables on different axes.
    - Scatter Plot: It is used to visualize the relationship between two variables on the same axes.
    - Bar Plot: It is used to visualize the distribution of categorical data.
    - Histogram: It is used to visualize the distribution of continuous data.
    - Heatmap: It is used to visualize the correlation between variables.

2. Here's how you can load the "fmri" dataset using the load_dataset function of seaborn and plot a line plot using x = "timepoint" and y = "signal" for different events and regions:
```python
import seaborn as sns

fmri = sns.load_dataset("fmri")
sns.lineplot(x="timepoint", y="signal", hue="event", style="region", data=fmri)
```

3. Here's how you can load the "titanic" dataset using the load_dataset function of seaborn and plot two box plots using x = 'pclass', y = 'age' and y = 'fare':
```python
import seaborn as sns

titanic = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
sns.boxplot(x="pclass", y="age", data=titanic)
sns.boxplot(x="pclass", y="fare", data=titanic)
```

4. Here's how you can use the "diamonds" dataset from seaborn to plot a histogram for the 'price' column. Use the hue parameter for the 'cut' column of the diamonds dataset:
```python
import seaborn as sns

diamonds = sns.load_dataset("diamonds")
sns.histplot(data=diamonds, x="price", hue="cut")
```

5. Here's how you can use the "iris" dataset from seaborn to plot a pair plot. Use the hue parameter for the "species" column of the iris dataset:
```python
import seaborn as sns

iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")
sns.pairplot(data=iris, hue="species")
```

6. Here's how you can use the "flights" dataset from seaborn to plot a heatmap:
```python
import seaborn as sns

flights = sns.load_dataset("flights")
flights = flights.pivot("month", "year", "passengers")
sns.heatmap(flights, annot=True, fmt="d")
```

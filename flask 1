Q1. **GET** and **POST** are two HTTP request methods used to retrieve or send data to a server. The **GET** method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data. The **POST** method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server¹³⁴⁵.

Q2. **request** is used in Flask to access the incoming data from the request, which includes the mimetype, referrer, IP address, raw data, HTTP method, and headers, among other things⁶⁷.

Q3. **redirect()** is used in Flask to redirect the user to another target location with specified status code⁹ [^10^] ¹¹¹³¹⁴.

Q4. **Templates** are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. In Flask, templates are used to render dynamic HTML pages. The **render_template()** function is used to render templates⁶.

Q5. Here's an example of a simple API:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
